# helloworld README

This is just a test extension to see if I can publish it to theia

## Features

This extension will also run in theia.  It's intent is to show specific context menu items when hello.js world.js and helloworld folders are "right clicked or option clicked" in the explorer.  This works fine in vscode, but when run in theia, the context menu items are not displayed.
